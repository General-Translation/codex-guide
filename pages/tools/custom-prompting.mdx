# Custom Prompting

Welcome to the **Custom Prompting** feature of Codex, a powerful tool designed to give you unprecedented control over your translation process. This feature is particularly useful for those who seek a tailored translation experience, offering a level of customization that ensures your translations meet your exact needs and preferences.

### How to Use Custom Prompting

When you’re ready to translate, but you have specific requirements or stylistic preferences, **Custom Prompting** is your go-to feature. Here’s how to make the most of it:

1. **Accessing Custom Prompting**: Locate and click on the **Custom Prompt** button located above the input area in the Codex interface. This action opens a dialogue box where you can input your unique instructions.

1. **Entering Instructions**: Within this box, you can specify exactly how you want Codex to handle your translation. Whether you need certain phrases translated in a specific way, desire a particular tone (be it formal, informal, technical, or playful), or have any other specific requirements, this is where you lay down your rules.

1. **Examples of Instructions**:

    - "Translate technical terms with precision, favoring industry jargon."
    - "Maintain a casual tone throughout the translation."
    - "Please use British English spelling and conventions."
    - "Translate ‘X’ as ‘Y’ consistently across the document."

1. **Applying Your Instructions**: Once you’ve entered your guidelines, simply press **Translate** and Codex will apply these rules as it translates your text, ensuring that the output aligns with your specified preferences.
