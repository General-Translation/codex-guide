# Getting Started

Welcome to your guide on getting started with Codex, where the accuracy of your translations hinges on a few key elements: your input text, its original language, the target language for translation, and the language model you select. Let’s break down these core components to help you navigate Codex with ease.

### Tokens

In the world of large language models (LLMs), tokens are like the currency of communication. They're the pieces of your text, but do not exactly line up 1:1 with words. For our free users, there's a  cap of 250 tokens per translation, which is around 200 words. If you feel the need for more, you can always upgrade to [Codex Alpha](https://www.codex.ai/plans), where users enjoy a doubled limit of 500 tokens. It’s our little way of saying thanks for joining the club.

### Translation

Codex isn’t just smart; it’s intuitive. It immediately identifies the language of your input, though you’re always free to specify it yourself for clarity. Once you've selected your desired translation language and model, all it takes is a click on the **Translate** button to see your text reimagined in another language. On the sidebar, you’ll find detailed stats - character count, word count, and token usage for both your original text and its translation. This feature ensures you have all the insights you need right at your fingertips, streamlining your translation process from start to finish.

### Parsing

When translating into a different language, understanding your translation is just as important as having it. Click on any word in your text or its translation, and a parsing box shows up with the word’s contextualized definition and its part of speech. This will help you understand not just the "what" but the "why" behind your translations.
