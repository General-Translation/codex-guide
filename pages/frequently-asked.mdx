##### Does Codex keep my content and/or translation data?

Similar to Google Docs or Microsoft OneDrive, we store your translations so that you can access them again later.

You can erase all data associated with your account whenever you choose, in line with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.codex.ai/privacy).

##### How up-to-date are the models used by Codex?

We follow developments in large language models (LLMs) closely. Whenever something better comes along, we’re on it – making sure Codex uses the best models on the market.
